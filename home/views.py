"""
Belle Musique Studio home app views configuration

After correcting any pylint issues, I was still left with the issue
'class has no objects member', the object is only added when the screen
is  rendered in the browser, so the issue is not valid. I followed
the steps available for the following stack overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45135263/class-has-no-objects-member
and created the .pylintrc file to customise the pylint settings to
prevent this error from displaying.

the index view is set up to display the homepage.

the About view is set up to display the about page. 

Contact View created to render the Contact page.
The view also references the Contact model
and form in order to update the fields within
the model tables.

Contact sent view rendered once a contact sent request has been
successfully submitted and sent.

Student showcase view utilised to render the form within which
admin can capture the information of the student to be showcased.
