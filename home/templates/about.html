                <p>
                    Jo-Anna Hope established the studio in January 1990 and has enjoyed success across the UK.
                    She teaches piano classes and vocal training to adults and school-going children in various
                    contemporary
                    styles, including praise and worship.</p>
                <p>
                    Jo-Anna not only coaches beginners of all ages, but encourages and promotes those who have a natural
                    flair for song writing, music production and performance, as well as those who suffer with remedial
                    learning disabilities. The syllabus, tailor-made for each student, does not include exams and each
                    student progresses at their own pace. Vocal coaching is encouraged on an individual basis. Vocal
                    classes are given as well as foundational 6 week classes. </p>
                <p>
                    The studio has enjoyed great success and expansion through the use of online classes. These have
                    been
                    made available to students both locally and
                    internationally via Skype and Zoom. </p>
                <p>
                    Jo-Anna began singing and performing at the age of 3 and playing the piano at the age of 4. She was
                    singing and writing original songs in her teens, performed locally and
                    abroad, has appeared on television shows, collaborated on 6 CD productions, and has won
                    various awards over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    Jo-Anna has a passion to motivate, teach and impart through music
                    lessons on an individual basis, but is also actively involved in training musicians within local
                    churches and providing insight and input into worship teams inter-denominationally.
