from django.contrib import messages
# Quite commonly in web applications, you need to display a one-time notification
# message (also known as “flash message”) to the user after processing a form or
#  some other types of user input.

#For this, Django provides full support for cookie- and session-based messaging,
# for both anonymous and authenticated users. The messages framework allows you
# to temporarily store messages in one request and retrieve them for display in a
# subsequent request (usually the next one). Every message is tagged with a specific level
# that determines its priority (e.g., info, warning, or error).
